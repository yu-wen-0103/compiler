README:
	You only need to enter "make", it will compile the .g file and testParser.java. And finally it will print the output that professor requires. The parser information is printed by each nonterminal, so that we can find what we want easily.
	In the makefile,because I put ANTRL tools on the last file, I write "../antlr~" to get the ANTLR tools.
